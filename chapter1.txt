Chapter 1:

The narrator, Nick Carraway, introduces himself and describes his background. He comes from a well-to-do family in the Midwest and moves to West Egg, Long Island, to work in finance.
Nick rents a small house next to the mansion owned by the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby.
Across the bay is East Egg, where Nick's cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom Buchanan, live.
Nick describes Tom as arrogant and aggressive, and Daisy as charming but seemingly unhappy.
Tom takes Nick to meet his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, in the city. They have an affair in an apartment Tom keeps for this purpose.
The chapter ends with Nick returning to his cottage, feeling both fascinated and repulsed by the world he's entered.
This chapter sets the stage for the novel, introducing the main characters, the setting, and hints at the themes of wealth, privilege, and moral decay that will be explored throughout the story.
